### Goal
To create a web-based chat client and server that supports the transfer of text to multiple users.

### Status
Basic user interface completed and server has been successfully tested.
Database is functional and tables have been created.
Account creation and signing in fully functional.
Messaging mostly functional.
Avatar and username customization almost finished.

### Next Steps
Add background and light/dark theme options.

Attempt to optimize message retrieval.
